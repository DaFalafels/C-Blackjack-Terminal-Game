# C# Blackjack Terminal Game
A terminal-based Blackjack game made in C# for a Computer Science Class in the 12th Grade at 
Milton District High School.

This is a game I created from scratch in 2015 as a final project to the Computer Science Class
I was taking at the time. I made it in Java at first in the 11th Grade, but it had some minor 
bugs which still needed to be ironed out. Still, because of my work done in this project I was
the first in my class.

This is a terminal-based Blackjack game that incorporates most of the Casino rules for Blackjack
to be played using the terminal. Later on, in the 12th Grade, I revisited this project by rewriting
it in C# while also fixing most of the bugs. It was a fun experience for me. Thank you for reading,
and I hope you enjoy having a look at my Java code.
