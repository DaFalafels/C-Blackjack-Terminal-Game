To play the game correctly you will need to know how it works:

	1. There are two people involved in this game, the dealer (computer) and the player.
	2. The dealer will use its 52 cards to distribute 26 random cards to the player and to keep the other 26 for itself.
	3. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's total number (value) but not exceed the number 21 for if you do you will lose.

Betting Options:

	1. Hit: If you hit, you take another card or cards in hopes of getting closer to 21. If the player's total exceeds 21 after hitting, the player is said to "bust" and loses the bet.
	2. Stand: If you stand, you elect to draw no more cards in hopes that the current total will beat the dealer.
	3. Double down: You may elect to double your original bet and receive only one more card regardless of its denomination.
	4. Split: If your first two cards are of the same denomination, you may elect to make a second bet equal to your first and split the pair, using each card as the first card in a separate hand.
	5. Insurance: If the dealer's faceup card is an ace, you may take "insurance", which essentially is a bet that the dealer has a 10-value card down to complete a blackjack. Insurance, which may be taken for half the original bet, pays 2-1 if the dealer has blackjack. The net effect is that if you win the insurance bet and lose the hand, you come out even.
